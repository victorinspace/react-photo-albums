# Dynamic Forms with React

## Description
Fork this repository and clone it on your computer. You'll notice that it is slightly different than what you're used to. The react application is now in a folder called `client` and you have some extra files in the root of the project. Their purpose is to serve up an api for you to use for this assignment. It is important that you run `npm start` from the root directory instead of within the `client` folder in order for your api to run alongside your React application.


## Normal Mode
Your job is to get a list of fields from a call to a json api and render those fields appropriately in your app.

## Hard Mode
Create a form that allows you to add a field to the database. It should have all the required pieces:
* type
* label
* id
* icon
* options
